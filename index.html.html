        <img src="cycle.jpeg"><a id="section-story">
        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">While taking in the sun and sea on a beach vacation in 2015, PwC consultant Namit Jain wondered why other cities in India could not rent out bikes if Goa could do it so easily. Back in Mumbai after his holiday, Namit caught up with friend Shanky Munoth, and they teamed up to launch bike rental company CycFit Bikes after extensive research. They were soon joined by Akashdeep Singhal, Kunal Gupta, and Shobit Saxena. Today, Mumbai and Bengaluru-based CycFit Bikes has close to 3,500 bikes in nine cities, and employs 130 people. Its annual revenue is close to Rs 7 crore, and with a burn of Rs 1.3 crore they are yet to break even, but post the best unit economics in the mobility industry. CycFit Bikes also has a B2B practice, and counts Ola and Uber among its first few clients.
            Before the company became a five-member founding team, Namit and Shanky had researched mobility solutions in more than 15 cities over a period of eight months. “Our findings showed that the Indian transport market has a huge gap when it comes to affordable, reliable and hassle-free mode of commute, both intra- as well as inter-city. The existing modes available at the time were either dispersed or expensive or over-burdened. There was a definite gap in the micro-mobility sector and CycFit Bikes began to fill that gap,” says Namit.
